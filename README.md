## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create a Hugging Face Access Token

Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a **User Access Token** with permission to call Inference Providers.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
HF_CHAT_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
HF_EMBEDDING_MODEL=thenlper/gte-large
HF_PROVIDER=hf-inference
```

> **Notes:**
> - `HF_CHAT_MODEL` must support chat completion on Hugging Face Inference Providers.
> - `HF_EMBEDDING_MODEL` must support feature extraction / embeddings.
> - If a model is unavailable for your provider, choose an alternative from its Hugging Face model page.

### 3. Add your hospital PDFs

Place your hospital documents inside the `data/` folder. Recommended files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `doctors.pdf` | Doctor names, specialties, contact info |
| `timings.pdf` | OPD and department schedules |
| `hospital_info.pdf` | Location, facilities, departments |

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
